# Phase 1: Foundation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Establish a working TypeScript development environment with linting, formatting, and testing.
**Verified:** 2026-01-29T18:57:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Developer can run `pnpm install` and get all dependencies installed | ✓ VERIFIED | pnpm install completes successfully; node_modules populated with tsc, vitest, biome binaries |
| 2 | Developer can run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` with Biome checking TypeScript files | ✓ VERIFIED | Both commands execute successfully; Biome checks 7 files in 14ms |
| 3 | Developer can run `pnpm test` and Vitest executes (even with no tests yet) | ✓ VERIFIED | Vitest runs with passWithNoTests: true; exits cleanly with "No test files found" |
| 4 | Developer can run `pnpm build` and TypeScript compiles with strict mode enabled | ✓ VERIFIED | tsc compiles src/index.ts to dist/index.js + .d.ts + .map files without errors |
| 5 | TypeScript module resolution uses `NodeNext` for Vercel compatibility | ✓ VERIFIED | tsconfig.json has "module": "NodeNext" and "moduleResolution": "NodeNext" |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| package.json | node_modules | pnpm install | ✓ WIRED | devDependencies present; pnpm install completes without errors |
| tsconfig.json | dist/ | tsc compilation | ✓ WIRED | outDir: "dist" in config; pnpm build generates dist/index.js + .d.ts + .map |
| package.json scripts.lint | biome.json | biome lint command | ✓ WIRED | Script calls "biome lint ."; biome.json configures rules; executes successfully |
| package.json scripts.format | biome.json | biome format command | ✓ WIRED | Script calls "biome format --write ."; executes successfully |
| package.json scripts.test | vitest.config.ts | vitest run command | ✓ WIRED | Script calls "vitest run"; vitest.config.ts loads; executes with passWithNoTests |
| package.json scripts.build | tsconfig.json | tsc command | ✓ WIRED | Script calls "tsc"; tsconfig.json configures compilation; generates output |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| INIT-01: TypeScript with strict: true and NodeNext | ✓ SATISFIED | tsconfig.json line 6: "strict": true; lines 4-5: "module"/"moduleResolution": "NodeNext" |
| INIT-02: pnpm with lock file | ✓ SATISFIED | pnpm-lock.yaml exists (31,539 bytes); pnpm install works |
| INIT-03: Package.json scripts (dev, build, test, lint, format) | ✓ SATISFIED | All 7 scripts present in package.json lines 9-16 |
| TOOL-01: Biome for linting and formatting | ✓ SATISFIED | biome.json configured; pnpm lint and pnpm format both execute successfully |
| TOOL-02: Vitest for testing | ✓ SATISFIED | vitest.config.ts configured; pnpm test executes successfully |

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None detected.**

Scanned for:
- TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments
- Placeholder text ("placeholder", "coming soon", "lorem ipsum")
- Empty implementations (return null, return {}, console.log only)
- Stub patterns

All files are substantive implementations with no placeholder content.

### Human Verification Required

**None.** All success criteria are verifiable programmatically through command execution and file inspection.

Phase 1 establishes tooling infrastructure. No visual UI, user flows, or external services to test manually.

## Verification Details

### Level 1: Existence Checks

All required artifacts exist:
- ✓ package.json
- ✓ pnpm-lock.yaml
- ✓ .gitignore
- ✓ tsconfig.json
- ✓ biome.json
- ✓ vitest.config.ts
- ✓ src/index.ts
- ✓ dist/index.js (generated by build)
- ✓ dist/index.d.ts (generated by build)
- ✓ node_modules/.bin/tsc
- ✓ node_modules/.bin/vitest
- ✓ node_modules/.bin/biome

### Level 2: Substantive Checks

All artifacts meet minimum line counts and contain real implementations:

| File | Min Lines | Actual Lines | Status |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| package.json | 10 | 28 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |
| tsconfig.json | 5 | 20 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |
| biome.json | 10 | 42 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |
| vitest.config.ts | 10 | 14 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |
| src/index.ts | 1 | 6 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |
| .gitignore | 5 | 28 | ✓ SUBSTANTIVE |

**Stub pattern checks:**
- 0 TODO/FIXME comments found
- 0 placeholder text patterns found
- 0 empty return statements found
- 0 console.log-only implementations found

All files have substantive content and proper exports.

### Level 3: Wiring Checks

```bash
$ pnpm install
Lockfile is up to date, resolution step is skipped
Already up to date
Done in 182ms
```
✓ WIRED: Dependencies install successfully

**tsconfig.json → dist/:**
```bash
$ pnpm build
> tsc
$ ls dist/
index.d.ts  index.d.ts.map  index.js  index.js.map
```
✓ WIRED: TypeScript compiles to dist/ with declarations and sourcemaps

**package.json scripts → tools:**
```bash
$ pnpm lint

$ pnpm format
Formatted 7 files in 2ms. No fixes applied.

$ pnpm test
No test files found, exiting with code 0
```
✓ WIRED: All scripts execute successfully

**Critical configuration checks:**
```bash
$ grep '"type": "module"' package.json
  "type": "module",

$ grep '"strict": true' tsconfig.json
    "strict": true,

$ grep '"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"' tsconfig.json
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",

$ grep 'passWithNoTests' vitest.config.ts
    passWithNoTests: true,
```
✓ WIRED: All critical settings present

```
✓ PASS — Vitest v4.0.17 runs; "No test files found, exiting with code 0"
```

**4. pnpm build compiles with strict mode**

```

**5. TypeScript uses NodeNext**
